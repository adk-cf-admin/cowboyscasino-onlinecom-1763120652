                "description": "\n<p>\nCowboys Casino is more than just a casino — it’s a modern tribute to the Wild West spirit. With cowboy hats, sculptures, themed decor, and even security staff in ten-gallon hats, the venue offers a festive and adventurous atmosphere. It’s where gaming meets entertainment, with live shows, dancing, and vibrant nightlife turning any evening into a memorable experience.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThe casino is open daily from 9:30 AM to 5:00 AM, making it accessible almost around the clock. This is perfect for those looking to continue the fun after attending events at Calgary Stampede, Scotiabank Saddledome, or other downtown attractions. Located in Victoria Park, Cowboys Casino sits at the heart of Calgary’s cultural district.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nInside, guests will find several bars and restaurants, including Centre Bar & Eatery, Hitman's Bar, Melrose, and Second Son. Each venue offers its own vibe and menu — from cocktails to full meals. All Day Happy Hour and food discounts make the experience even more enjoyable.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nWhile the casino doesn’t have its own hotel, there are plenty of nearby options. Within walking distance are Ramada Plaza, Fairfield Inn & Suites, and HI Calgary for budget travelers, and the stylish Hotel Arts with a pool and free bikes for those seeking comfort and flair.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nCowboys Casino hosts regular events, parties, themed shows, and tournaments. It’s a place to play and celebrate. The Winner’s Edge loyalty program lets players earn rewards, join promotions, and access exclusive offers. For guests aged 55 and older, the Elite 55 daytime program offers extra perks and benefits.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nCowboys Casino is the perfect destination for those seeking thrill, style, and a true celebration vibe. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned player, a tourist or a local, there’s something for everyone here.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<h3 style = \"font-weight: bold;font-size: 32px;\">\nComfort and Convenience: How Cowboys Casino Welcomes Guests\n<\/h3>\n\n<p>\nAt Cowboys Casino, guest service and accessibility are top priorities. The primary language spoken by staff is English, in line with Canadian standards. However, many employees are trained to assist international visitors and can communicate in basic French and Spanish. Courtesy, friendliness, and a willingness to help are key elements of the casino’s welcoming atmosphere.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\nIn terms of payment, the casino accepts both cash and major credit cards. Guests can use Visa and Mastercard for deposits and withdrawals, making transactions smooth and convenient. Slot machines operate with bills and vouchers rather than coins, reflecting modern gaming practices.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\nCowboys Casino is equipped with ATMs that dispense Canadian dollars, and currency exchange services are available at the cashier desk. This is especially helpful for international tourists who need to convert their money safely and efficiently. Staff are available to assist with current rates and secure transactions.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>The casino also features bonus programs and the Winner’s Edge loyalty system. Members enjoy special offers, free spins, access to exclusive events, and the ability to earn points with every game. This adds extra value to the entertainment experience.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 style = \"font-weight: bold;font-size: 32px;\">\nPreparing for Your Visit to Cowboys Casino\n<\/h3>\n\n<p>\nVisiting Cowboys Casino is not just about gaming — it’s about enjoying a stylish and comfortable experience. The casino maintains a moderate dress code: guests are asked to avoid clothing with profanity, crude images, or overly revealing outfits. This helps ensure a respectful and enjoyable environment for everyone.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nTo enter the casino, guests must present original government-issued photo ID with a birth date and unique identifier. Digital copies or photos of documents are not accepted. The minimum age for entry is 18. Backpacks and large bags are not allowed on the casino floor and must be checked at the coat check, which is complimentary outside peak hours.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nBringing outside alcohol, illegal substances, or weapons is strictly prohibited. Security staff may inspect bags and deny entry if a guest refuses a check. These measures are in place to ensure the safety of all visitors.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nCowboys Casino is easily accessible by car or public transit. It offers free heated underground parking for vehicles under 6 feet 1 inch in height. If a guest is unable to drive safely, they are encouraged to leave their vehicle overnight and retrieve it within 24 hours. The Victoria Park C-Train station is just a five-minute walk from the casino.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nIn short, Cowboys Casino prioritizes comfort, safety, and accessibility. By following a few simple rules, guests can enjoy a welcoming and exciting atmosphere.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n\n\n<div\n lang=\"en\"\n     style=\"\n       -webkit-columns: 320px 2;\n       -moz-columns: 320px 2;\n       columns: 320px 2;\n\n        -webkit-column-gap: 1.2em;\n       -moz-column-gap: 1.2em;\n       column-gap: 1.2em;\n \n       hyphens: auto;\n\">\n\n\n   <!-- Левая колонка -->\n    <div style=\"break-inside: avoid; -webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; -moz-column-break-inside: avoid;\">\n        <h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">Dress Code<\/h4>\n            <ul>\n            <li>• \nNo profanity or crude images\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nNo overly revealing clothing\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n        <\/ul>\n        <br>\n\n        <h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">Entry Requirements<\/h4>\n             <ul>\n            <li>• \nOriginal photo ID\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nAge 18+\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nNo backpacks or large bags\n<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <!-- Правая колонка -->\n    <div style=\"break-inside: avoid; -webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; -moz-column-break-inside: avoid;\">\n        <h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">Prohibited Items<\/h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li>• \nOutside alcohol\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nIllegal substances and weapons\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nRefusal of bag check = denied entry\n\n\n<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n        <br>\n\n        <h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">Parking & Transit<\/h4>\n            <ul>\n            <li>• \nFree heated underground parking\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nOvernight parking allowed\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nClose to C-Train station\n<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<br>\n\n<h3 style = \"font-weight: bold;font-size: 32px;\">\nWinner’s Edge: Rewards, Points & Perks for Loyal Guests\n<\/h3>\n\n<p> \nThe Winner’s Edge loyalty program is Alberta’s province-wide casino rewards system, available at Cowboys Casino. It’s designed to make every visit more exciting and rewarding. Membership is completely free, and registration takes just a few minutes. Once registered, you receive a personalized card that lets you earn points every time you play slots or electronic table games.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p> \nPoints are earned at a rate of 1 point per $1–$5 played, and can be redeemed for Free Play — 1,000 points = $1 CAD — or used to enter exclusive contests and prize draws.

The program includes regular promotions, bonus point events, VIP experiences, and special offers.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p> \nFor guests aged 55+, there’s a dedicated daytime program called Elite 55, which includes lunch specials, slot tournaments, and themed events.
